The Resume QR Code Verification System is a web-based application designed to streamline the hiring process for businesses by ensuring that only verified and serious job applicants are considered. The finished product will include several key features. Job seekers will be able to upload their resumes to the system, which will then convert the resume into a unique QR code. This QR code will contain a secure link to the applicant's verified resume and identity details. Employers will receive the QR codes via physical mail. Once scanned, the QR code will direct the employer to a secure portal where they can access the applicant's verified resume and identity details. The portal will ensure that only authorized users (employers) can access the applicant's information, enhancing security and reducing the risk of fraudulent applications.
